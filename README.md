## Purpose

Welcome!

In summary, Open PSX is a non-profit initiative that aims to encourage explore this platform as obscure as the playstation is. 

The idea is to organize, create, point and maintain quality content for enthusiasts.

We aim to meet this goal by using the GitHub platform, as it makes it possible to unify discussions, people, and code in one place, in a way that facilitates the search and relationship between them.

GitHub's strengths:

* Space used by almost all developers
* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as standard formatting language.
* [Excellent internal search tool](https://github.com/search?utf8=).
* It's a social network

The structure of this organization was mirrored in [this excellent Brazillian project.](http://frontendbr.com.br/) 
We thank them.

## Guidelines and Best Practices

Before creating an issue you should consider the following guidelines:

### Search

An essential skill for developers is knowing how to do good research. Many beginner questions can be answered with simple searches, so before posting your question make sure you have done the necessary searches and bring the data you have found and the data you did not find on the subject to the issue.

#### Search the forum

1. Use the search function at the top of this repository (make sure it is not on a *fork*).

2. Search for upcoming issues, your question may have been answered on some similar issue.

#### Search the Internet

1. If your question is about a specific language or tool, ask your question in the official documentation of that language / tool.

2. If the above does not resolve, please use [Google](https://www.google.com)

3. Try searching in English, even if you need to use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com)

4. Give preference to results from official documentation and specialized forums, eg:
  * [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/)
  * [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

### Other points

* Write correctly and well punctuated.
* Avoid getting out of the initial scope of the issue. If necessary, create a new one and mention the number.
* If you need help in a code, please provide snippets, gists, and remember, no one has an obligation to solve your problem.
* Do not be a monologue that talks only about you. Interact with the answers, cite people, generate a healthy and constructive discussion. After all, the more information, the richer our environment will be and will help more people.

## When to create an Issue?

### Doubts

Focus your issues on real issues. Include details about what you tried and exactly what you are trying to do.

Ideally, before you create a question you should try to solve the problem yourself, most of the time a brief Google search can help you find a solution.

Remember to research hard before opening an issue, there are good chances your question has already been answered and documented over the internet.

### Discussions

Discussions are always welcome, when formulating an issue, try to be as direct as possible about what you intend to address, if necessary open more than one thread, one for each subject.

### Tools

Have you discovered a new tool or any other resource that can help group members? Do not hesitate to share with us we are looking forward to your tip

### General

If your post does not fit into any of the above categories, no problem. Since it deals with open source we will be willing to discuss and help.

## Code of Conduct

Like any civilized place, there are some rules that must be followed to provide a better experience for everyone.

* Respect to be respected. Do not write something that might offend someone. Reflect if the text is not aggressive / rude before sending.

* Keep criticism in ideas, not in people.

* No harassment or discrimination related to personal characteristics or choices, as well as bullying, sexism, racism or any other type of action that may cause embarrassment to other participants will be allowed.

* Behave professionally. Participants who violate such rules will be invited to withdraw or be banned because of the seriousness of their actions.
